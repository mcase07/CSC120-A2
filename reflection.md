What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I feel like my assignment could have gone smoother, especially at the beginning if I had understood the functions of procedural_resale_shop.py better. I eventually found out that I could understand each function better by running them one by one in main.py. It was also generally hard because it's been a while since I coded in Python and so I was a bit shaky on ideas like dictionaries, lists, etc. I think after I consulted some references, I understood better what it meant to project in an object-oriented way and things went smoother after that.
